        <p>There have been several notable instances of ransomware.  These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WannaCry</strong>  WannaCry is a ransomware that is believed to have originated in North Korea.  In May of 2017, WannaCry targeted Windows systems, encrypting data and demanding Bitcoin in order to decrypt, or unlock, the data.  However, many users who paid the "ransom" for their data reported that they, in fact, did not 
            gain access to their encrypted data.  Eventually, a patch was made to cover the exploits made by WannaCry, and attacks subsided, but not before users paid over $130,000 in ransom money to gain access to their data.  It is estimated that WannaCry attacked over 200,000 computers resulting in several millions of dollars worth in lost data.                  Notable victims of WannaCry include the National Health System of the UK, Hitachi, Honda, Telefonica, and PetroChina.</li>
            <li><strong>Bad Rabbit</strong> Bad Rabbit is a ransomware similar to Wannacry, encrypting a user's files and demanding payment in Bitcoin.  However, Bad Rabbit employed a fake Adobe update in order to install its malware.  Fortunately, Bad Rabbit was not as successful and widespread as WannaCry, being discovered and eliminated from                     the Internet within a few days.</li>
            <li><strong>Jigsaw</strong> Jigsaw is a ransomware that pops up the puppet from the Saw movies, encrypts all the user's files, and then threatens to delete files until the ransom is paid.  As the malware was written C#, it was reverse-engineered to remove the encryption without a ransom being necessary.</li>
         </ul>
