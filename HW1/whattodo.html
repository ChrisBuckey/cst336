        <h2>What to Do If You Become the Victim of Ransomware?</h2>
        <p>Ransomware, when it appears on your screen, can be unnerving.  However experts advise victims of malware that, in any case, <i>do not pay the ransom</i>, however small it may be, because there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will fix the problem, and you are probably lending to international cyberterrorism.  In fact, it is estimated that only 19% of ransomware victims re-gain access to their files.</p>
        <br />
        <p> A best case scenario would be to wipe the infected systems clean and re-install the affected data using backup systems.  However, many victims do not have a backup system, in which case their files might be permanently lost.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, not all is lost if you are a victim of ransomware and you do not have a backup system.  Many forms of ransomware have been reverse-engineered to a point where files affected could be decrypted, and thus allowing users to gain access to their files again and, hopefully, make backup copies this time.</p>
