        <p id="welcomeText">Ransomware is a form of malware.  However, unlike many versions of malware, the goal of ransomware is financial profit, rather than power over one's system. Ransomware hijacks the user's files and encrypts them, leaving the user unable to access their files.  
        A message pops up informing the user that if they would like their files back, to pay a fee via some anonymous means (i.e. "the ransom").  Some forms of ransomware include a clock by which the data would be erased if the user did not pay, or in which the ransom increases.    
           However, there is no guarantee that access to the files will be given after payment.  Because   Ransomware has recently become one of the most popular and sophisticated types of malware, with the rise of anonymous payment systems like cryptocurrency and MoneyPak. </p>
